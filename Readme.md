This is a Python script that demonstrates an image zoom and pan functionality using the pygfx and wgpu libraries. It allows you to load an image and interactively zoom and pan within the image using the mouse wheel and mouse drag.


### Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher
imageio library (pip install imageio)
pygfx library (pip install pygfx)
wgpu library (pip install wgpu)
Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (see "Requirements" section).

Run the following command to execute the script:

```shell
python image_zoom_pan_demo.py
```

The script will launch a GUI window displaying a white canvas.

* Drag and drop an image file (e.g., memory_base.png) onto the canvas.

* Use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the image.

* Click and drag the mouse to pan across the image.

### Further Improvements
* Image Preloading: Add support for preloading multiple images and selecting them interactively.

* Keyboard Controls: Implement keyboard shortcuts to control zooming and panning.

* Limit Zoom Levels: Set minimum and maximum zoom levels to restrict the zoom range.

* Smooth Transitions: Add smooth animation transitions for zooming and panning movements.

* Image Scaling: Allow the image to scale automatically to fit the canvas size.

* User Interface: Create a simple UI panel to display image information and control options.

* Error Handling: Implement error handling for cases such as invalid image file format or loading failures.

* Performance Optimization: Optimize rendering and interaction performance for large images or complex scenes.
